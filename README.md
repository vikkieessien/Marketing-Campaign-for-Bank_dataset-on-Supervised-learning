# Marketing-Campaign-for-Bank_dataset-on-Supervised-learning

# The data set is from Kaggle.
* A clean data set that had no missing value.

* The dataset is about a bank's marketing campaign that offers clients a term deposit in the bank. The company approched it's clients mostly by telephone and a * target variable was assigned according to the client's answer: 'yes' if they want to make the investment and 'no' otherwise.

* A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually  carry short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp.

* I did Exploratory Data Analysis to see the impact of the marketing campaign and the the reasons why some of the target market responded either positvely or negatively to the campain.

* I made prediction using supervised learning.
